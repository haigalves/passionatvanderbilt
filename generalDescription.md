# What is Passion at Vanderbilt?

Passion at Vanderbilt is a data journalism project organized by the Vanderbilt Hustler's data section which seeks to provide a quantitative approach to the issue of passion and drive as decisive factors in career and life choices made by college students at Vanderbilt University.

## Mission

The mission of the Passion at Vanderbilt project is to apply a data-driven approach to try and quantify how much of a role does passion play inside the Vanderbilt community.

## Vision

The vision of the project is to use data journalism and analysis as a means to stir a discussion within the Vanderbilt student body on how the community's efforts can go beyond CV building and individual interests, thus expressing loyalty to Vanderbilt's "Crescere Aude" motto in a societal plane.

## What will be the structure of Passion at Vanderbilt?

Passion at Vanderbilt will have three main axes of action, all based on the general principle of using data to measure something as immaterial and subjective as passion. The three axes will be structured as follows:

# Data collection and analysis

Data will be collected both from primary and secondary sources, laid out as follows:

## Primary sources

### Surveys

Surveys will be conducted to accrue information from the following sources:

1. Student organizations: professional fraternities, clubs, etc.
2. Faculty members: professors with long trajectory, TAs...
3. Student body: students, grad students (preferrably those who did undergrad at Vandy)

The purpose of the surveys will be to measure the following variables:

1. Source of motivation: What drives students' involvement beyond classes?
2. Evolution of the source over time: How has passion's role at Vanderbilt evolved over time?
3. Ideal vs. reality: How do sources of motivation look for the surveyed people in an ideal world?

Some potential questions to ask are the following:

1. For student organizations: How has the job market affected enrollment and participation in the organization?
2. For faculty members: Do the classes they teach or the organizations they participate in have a career focus or an entertainment one?
3. For students: What would you qualify as the main source of energy for your interest in the organizations you are a part of?

### AnchorLink data

API access to AnchorLink would be a home run. Still working on it.

## Secondary sources

### Historic archive of the Vanderbilt Hustler

The Hustler's entire run is digitized by both Central Library and the Hustler website. Scraping text from here to find the recurrence of buzzwords such as "passion", "CV", "involvement" could be an easy way of studying our phenomenon.

### Founding time of certain student organizations

Tracking student orgs vs. time and job market could be an interesting way of measuring the role played by passion through indirect observation.
